# Kernel

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file in the folder for Kernel server.
This sets up what is needed to work with Kernel development.

## Metrics

### CLI

You can monitor the Kernel from the CLI.
Install the `dotnet counters` tool:

```shell
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-counters
```

After you have started the Kernel you need to find the process id.
This can be done by running the following:

```shell
dotnet counters ps
```

Find the process for the Kernel:

```shell
 2483  Cratis.Ke  /Source/Kernel/Server/bin/Debug/net6.0/Cratis.Chronicle.Server
```

Then use the process id as parameter for the monitor:

```shell
dotnet counters monitor --process-id 2483 --counters Cratis.Chronicle
```

You should then be seeing something similar:

```shell
Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
    Status: Running

[Cratis.Chronicle]

        event_sequence_id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000,m           0
        event_sequence_id=ae99de1e-b19f-4a33-a5c4-3908508ce59f,m           0

    cratis-connected-clients-12c737d2-e816-46f4-96fd-67fc1bf7108           1
```

### Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) has been configured for collecting metrics from the Kernel in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
It leverages an Open Telemetry exporter that the Kernel connects to with the configuration in `chronicle.json` file as below:

```json
{
    "telemetry": {
        "type": "open-telemetry",
        "options": {
            "endpoint": "http://localhost:4317"
        }
    }
}
```

Once the Kernel is running you can navigate to the following location:
http://localhost:9090/graph?g0.expr=appended_events&g0.tab=0&g0.stacked=0&g0.show_exemplars=0&g0.range_input=15m

### Zipkin

[Zipkin](https://zipkin.io) has been configured for collecting metrics from the Kernel in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
It leverages an Open Telemetry exporter that the Kernel connects to with the configuration in `chronicle.json` file as below:

```json
{
    "telemetry": {
        "type": "open-telemetry",
        "options": {
            "endpoint": "http://localhost:4317"
        }
    }
}
```

Once the Kernel is running you can navigate to the following location:
http://localhost:9411/zipkin/?lookback=15m&endTs=1681920441136&limit=10
