# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## C# Instructions

- Always use the latest version C#, currently C# 13 features.
- Write clear and concise comments for each function.
- Prefer `var` over explicit types when declaring variables.
- Do not add unnecessary comments or documentation.
- Use `using` directives for namespaces at the top of the file.
- Sort the `using` directives alphabetically.
- Use namespaces that match the folder structure.
- Remove unused `using` directives.
- Use file-scoped namespace declarations.
- Use single-line using directives.
- For types that does not have an implementation, don't add a body (e.g., `public interface IMyInterface;`).

## Header

All files should start with the following header:

```csharp
// Copyright (c) Cratis. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the MIT license. See LICENSE file in the project root for full license information.
```

## Naming Conventions

- Follow PascalCase for component names, method names, and public members.
- Use camelCase for private fields and local variables.
- Prefix private fields with an underscore (e.g., `_privateField`).
- Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., IUserService).

# Formatting

- Honor the existing code style and conventions in the project.
- Apply code-formatting style defined in `.editorconfig`.
- Prefer file-scoped namespace declarations and single-line using directives.
- Insert a newline before the opening curly brace of any code block (e.g., after `if`, `for`, `while`, `foreach`, `using`, `try`, etc.).
- Ensure that the final return statement of a method is on its own line.
- Use pattern matching and switch expressions wherever possible.
- Use `nameof` instead of string literals when referring to member names.
- Ensure that XML doc comments are created for any public APIs. When applicable, include `<example>` and `<code>` documentation in the comments.

## Nullable Reference Types

- Always use `is null` or `is not null` instead of `== null` or `!= null`.
- Trust the C# null annotations and don't add null checks when the type system says a value cannot be null.

## Testing

- Follow the following guide: [How to Write Specs](./instructions/tests.instructions.md)

## Things to not touch

- Do not change the `global.json` file unless explicitly asked.
