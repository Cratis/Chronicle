# ðŸ§ª How to do pull requests

- Follow the [pull request template](../pull_request_template.md).
    - Primarily focus on the Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security, and Deprecated sections. The summary can most likely be omitted.
    - The description is used as the GitHub release description so make it nice and descriptive and to the point.
- Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and guidelines.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Label your pull request appropriately according to semantic versioning for what type of improvement the PR is offering (major, minor, patch).
- Add a link to the issue it addresses on every bullet-point added in parentheses (e.g., (#123)) at the end of the bullet point, if applicable.
