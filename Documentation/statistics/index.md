# Build Statistics

This section contains build statistics for the Chronicle project, tracking key metrics over time.

## Test Coverage

View the interactive [test coverage dashboard](index.html) to see coverage trends across all projects.

The coverage statistics are collected during each publish and show:
- Overall coverage percentage per project
- Historical trends over time
- Interactive filtering by project

The data is collected weekly to track progress and identify areas that may need additional test coverage.
