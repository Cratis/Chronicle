# Build Statistics

This section contains build statistics for the Chronicle project, tracking key metrics over time.

## Test Coverage

The interactive test coverage dashboard shows coverage trends across all projects (view the `index.html` file in this directory).

The coverage statistics are collected during each publish and show:
- Overall coverage percentage per project
- Historical trends over time
- Interactive filtering by project

The data is collected weekly to track progress and identify areas that may need additional test coverage.
