# Principles

* Be where the developers are - integrate into existing most popular development environments / frameworks.
* Truly democratize; focus on the majority of developers.
* Don't force principles and approaches onto developers.
* Always ask the question; can it be made simpler?
* Enable developers to create well architected solutions without them having to do so consciously.

## Development principles

* Don't fall into the "not invented here" pitfall.
* Focus on maintainability of the code.
* Code should be tested and made testable.
* Favor characteristics over principles (CUPID over SOLID).
