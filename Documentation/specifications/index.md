# Specifications

For writing specifications or automated tests, Cratis provides an extension that makes it simpler to assert
correctness with code using the Cratis artifacts.

You can find the extension as a NuGet package [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Aksio.Cratis?logo=nuget)](http://nuget.org/packages/aksio.cratis.specifications)

Its all been built on top of the [Aksio Specifications](https://github.com/aksio-insurtech/Specifications).
All of the building blocks can still be used in a standard xUnit test if desired.

Below are the different artifacts supported.
