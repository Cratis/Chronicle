# Aksio Cratis

The goal of the Aksio Cratis project is to provide productivity platform in the event sourcing space.
Built from the ground up it offers an event sourcing platform with tooling and an application development
model aimed at solving common problems.

If you want to contribute, please read more [here](./contributing.md).

The platform is built on top of a set of concepts that is vital to understand, you can find them [here](./concepts/index.md).
We also have [guidance](./guidance/index.md) for how to work with Cratis and other more general concepts.
