# Connection Strings

Connection strings define how clients connect to the Chronicle server. They capture the host, port, authentication, and TLS options in a single, portable value.

Use the following topics to understand what the server supports and how clients configure and consume connection strings:

- [Server support](server.md)
- [DotNET client usage](dotnet-client.md)
- [Configuration](configuration.md)
