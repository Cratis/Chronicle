# Contributing to Clients

Below are the core principles for building public facing APIs exposed in our clients:

- APIs should be lovable
- Provide sane defaults but make them flexible, extensible and overridable
- Consistency is king
- It should be easy to do things right, hard to do things wrong
- Never expose more than is needed
