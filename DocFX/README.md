# Documentation Site project

To get started with local development perform a `dotnet restore` and then `yarn`.
Then all you need to do is run `yarn watch` and after build and the Web server has started navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
It will watch for any changes and rebuild and restart the web server after this.

Everything is configured through the `docfx.json` file, documentation for the file can be found [here](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx.exe_user_manual.html#3-docfxjson-format).

## Template

We've configured using the [SingulinkFX](https://github.com/Singulink/SingulinkFX) template.
