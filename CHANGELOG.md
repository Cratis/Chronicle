# [v2.4.3] - 2021-10-1 [PR: #21](https://github.com/Cratis/cratis/pull/21)

# [v2.4.1] - 2021-10-1 [PR: #18](https://github.com/Cratis/cratis/pull/18)

### Fixed

- Fixing ServiceCollection extension APIs from version 2.4.0. Instead of `Use*`for the methods, its now `Add*`. Should've been major version, but since this mistake was done 20 minutes ago - no one has consumed it yet :).

# [v2.3.2] - 2021-10-1 [PR: #16](https://github.com/Cratis/cratis/pull/16)
