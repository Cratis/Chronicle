Cratis Chronicle is an Event Sourcing database built with ease of use, productivity, compliance and maintainability in mind.
It provides the core server, referred to as the **Kernel** with a .NET client SDK to access it and tooling built into it.

Although optimized for MongoDB, its extensible model provides extension points for other data stores.
