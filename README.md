## Introduction

Cratis is an Event Sourcing platform built with ease of use, productivity, compliance and maintainability in mind.
It provides the core platform, referred to as the **Kernel** with client SDK (.NET only for the time being) and tooling
built into it. In addition Cratis offers an application model aimed towards productivity and bringing in concepts
such as CQRS; opinionated and completely optional.

Read the documentation on our site [https://cratis.io](https://cratis.io) for all the details.
For general guidance on the core values and principles we @ Aksio use, read more [here](https://github.com/aksio-insurtech/Home/blob/main/profile/README.md).

## Opening in VSCode online

If you prefer to browse the code in VSCode, you can do so by clicking [here](https://vscode.dev/github/aksio-insurtech/Cratis).

## Running the samples

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [.NET Core 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [Node JS version 16](https://nodejs.org/)

The sample consists of a backend and a frontend.
Navigate to the [Bank Sample](./Samples/Banking/Bank) folder.

Before running the microservice backend and frontend, we will need to run the Cratis Kernel.

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

This will bring up the Cratis Kernel and expose the following ports:

| Port | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 27017 | MongoDB - used for events and projection results |
| 8080 | Workbench and API for kernel |
| 11111 | Clustering port |
| 30000 | Client to Kernel connectivity |

Within here you'll see a folder called [Main](./Samples/Banking/Bank/Main), which represents the backend startup.
Navigate to this and start the backend by running:

```shell
dotnet run
```

The frontend is located in the [Web](./Samples/Banking/Bank/Web) folder. While the backend is running in another terminal,
navigate to that folder and start it by running:

```shell
yarn start:dev
```

Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:9100/](http://localhost:9100/) and you can start playing
around with the sample.

> Note: The Cratis workbench is available [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## Contributing / Running locally

If you're looking to either contribute or dive into the code by building and running the Cratis Kernel locally,
you can read more [here](./Documentation/contributing.md).
